# dum-language

considering how I followed a [tutorial](https://youtube.com/@tylerlaceby) for a head-start, you should watch some of the tutorials to understand. or you're a giga-nerd who intuitively gets this stuff.

## what does it do

Full list with exlpanations and examples can be found in the [documentation](./DOCUMENTATION.md).

Users can:

- Declare custom variables
- Use native variables
- Declare custom functions
- Use native functions
- Use, call, and create objects(dictionaries) and arrays(lists)
- Do basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)
- Use global functions and objects like `Object`, `evalFile`, `eval`, `readFile`, `print`, etc
- Compare 2 values using ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
- Get elements of arrays using brackets
- Compute object properties using brackets
- Run all of the above in while loops, for loops, and if statements
- And probably more on the way.

If for whatever reason you download this repository and use for it any practical reason, may god have mercy on you.
