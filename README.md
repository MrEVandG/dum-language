# dum-language

considering how I followed a [tutorial](https://youtube.com/@tylerlaceby) for a head-start, you should watch some of the tutorials to understand. or you're a giga-nerd who understands this stuff.

## what does it do

Users can:

- Declare custom variables
- Use native variables
- Declare custom functions
- Use native functions
- Use, call, and create objects(dictionaries) and arrays(lists)
- do basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)
- Run all of the above in while and for loops
- And probably more on the way.

If for whatever reason you download this repository and use for it any practical reason, may I have mercy on you.
